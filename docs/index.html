              <b>Summary</b> <br />
              This page is used to inform users regarding the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Data if deciding to use the Application.<br /><br />

              If the User chooses to use the Application, then they agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Data collected is used for providing and improving the Application. The Owner will not use or share information except as described in this Privacy Policy. <br /><br />

              <b>Owner and Data Controller</b> <br />
              Keegan Jebb <br />
              Owner contact email: runnerscircleapp@gmail.com <br /><br />

              <b>Information Collection and Use</b> <br />

              For a better experience, while using the Application, the Owner may require the User to provide certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to first name, last name, email, password, and precise location. The information that the Owner requests is retained on the User’s device and is shared with the third-party services that host the cloud database used by the Application. This data is located in the US (and possibly Canada if a resident). In addition, by using the Application, the User allows their full name, email and location to be shared with other users with whom they choose to participate with while using the Application. Other data sent from the User’s device to the third-party database and to other participants includes running data such as distance run and pace of the run. Location data in particular is required and used exclusively for the functionality of the Application, and is only collected and shared while using the Application. To help ensure the privacy of users, once active use of the Application is terminated, the location data and running data is erased from the third-party servers and, in the case of location data, from device memory of other users.<br /><br />

              The Application does use third-party services that may collect and process information used for identification in addition to data collected by the app. This information includes IP addresses, Cookies, Log Data, user agents and unique device identifiers for advertising (Google Advertiser ID or IDFA, for example). Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Log Data, collected automatically when using this Application. Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.<br /><br />

              Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available. Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this Application and confirm that they have the third-party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.<br /><br />

              The third-party service providers used by the Application are:<br />
              •	Firebase Authentication<br />
              •	Firebase Real-time Database<br />
              •	Firebase Analytics<br />
              •	AdMob<br /><br />

              <b>Cookies</b> <br />
              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to the browser from the websites and are stored on a device's internal memory.<br /><br />

              This Application does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the Application may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. The User has the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to the device. If the User chooses to refuse cookies, they may not be able to use some portions of this Application.<br /><br />

              <b>Service Providers</b> <br />
              The Owner may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:<br /><br />
              •	To facilitate the Application;<br />
              •	To provide the Application on our behalf;<br />
              •	To perform Application-related services; or<br />
              •	To assist us in analyzing how the Application is used.<br /><br />

              These third parties have access to the User’s Personal Data. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.<br /><br />

              <b>Security</b> <br />
              The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.<br /><br />

              <b>Deleting Personal Data</b> <br />
              Users have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.<br /><br />

              <b>“Do Not Track” Requests</b> <br />
              This Application does not support “Do Not Track” requests.  To determine whether any of the third-party services it uses honor the “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.<br /><br />

              <b>Information Not Contained in This Policy</b> <br />
              More details concerning the collection or processing of Personal Data may be requested from the Owner at any time. Please see the contact information at the beginning or end of this document.<br /><br />

              <b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b> <br />
              The Owner reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving notice to its Users on this page and possibly within this Application and/or - as far as technically and legally feasible - sending a notice to Users via any contact information available to the Owner. It is strongly recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the bottom. <br /><br />
